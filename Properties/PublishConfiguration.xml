# Improved Pie Charts

Improved pie charts in info views.

# Chart Settings
Change all pie charts in the info views by manipulating the following chart settings in the mod's Options.

### Chart Type
Choose between three chart types:
- Pie Chart.  A round pie chart as in the base game (default).
- Bar Chart.  A horizontal bar chart that is more compact than the Pie Chart.
- No Chart.  No pie chart or bar chart is displayed.

The No Chart option is especially useful to reduce or even eliminate the scroll bar on
the Outside Connections and Building Level info views for the common 1920 x 1080 resolution.

### Pie Chart Size
Diameter of the pie chart in pixels.
Default is 125 pixels, same as the base game.

### Pie Chart Hole Size
Size of the hole in the center of the pie chart as a percent of the diameter.
Larger values create a larger center hole and a smaller ring thickness.
Smaller values create a smaller center hole and a larger ring thickness.
Default is 60%, same as the base game.

### Bar Chart Height
Height of the bar chart in pixels.
Default is 25 pixels, which is the same as the pie chart ring thickness in the base game.

### Chart Animation
Whether or not to animate the pie chart and bar chart when first displayed.
When not animated, the complete chart is displayed immediately.
Default is animated (checked), same as the base game.

### Reset Settings
Reset all chart settings to their default values.

# Compatibility
The mod is translated into all the languages supported by the base game.

There are no known mods with which this mod is incompatible.

This mod can be safely disabled or unsubscribed at any time.
